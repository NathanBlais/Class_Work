Q1. Because when strcat() concatenates the second string to the first, it writes to the existing array. Because the array is too small, it does not output properly.

Q2. One way to fix the bug is to allocate more memory than is needed.

Ex: char hello[20] = "hello ";

Q3. To run a program you use the command "run". 

C doesn't provide the same kind of bounds-checking on arrays that Java does because that leads to inefficiency. It assumes you will write the code properly yourself.

Q4. 

Pro: efficiency
Con: No error corection.
