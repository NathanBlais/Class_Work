(a) No one has lost more than one thousand dollars playing the lottery.

Let L(x) be the propositional function "x has lost more than one thousand dollars playing the lottery"
quantifier: ¬∃xL(x)

negation: ∃xL(x)

negation in English: There exists a person who has lost more than one thousand dollars playing the lottery


(b) There is a student in this class who has chatted with exactly one other student.

Let C(x,y) be the propositional function "x has chatted with y"
quantifier: ∃x∃!y [C(x,y)∧ x≠y] or ∀z∃x∃y[(C(x,y)∧(y≠x)) ∧ (C(x,z)→(z=x)∨(z=y))]

negation: ∃z∀x∀y[(¬C(x,y)∨(y=x)) ∨ (C(x,z)∧(z≠x)∧(z≠y)]

negation in English: All students have chased with only themselves or with more that two people.
